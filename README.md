# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
EDA on some of the csv files.
A basic approach to analyze the data sets to get some insights from them,summarizing the main characteristics,and getting better understanding patterns within the data.
I have tried Exploratory Data Analysis on some csv data files on basic level for showcasing my Pandas,numpy,matplotlib etc. and other useful libraries of python.
